    "- Use this label when the statement is **largely true** but not perfect.\n",

    "**🤔 half-true**  \n",
    "- The statement contains a **mix of accurate and inaccurate elements**.  \n",

    "2. **Context**: The circumstances or background in which the statement was made.\n",
    "3. **Speaker Credibility**: The speaker’s past record and alignment (e.g., party affiliation, job title).\n",
    "4. **Supporting Evidence**: Whether the claim is backed by reliable sources or data.\n",
